Draftail is built with [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). Let’s start by installing them both, as well as Draftail:

```sh
npm install --save draftail draft-js@^0.10.5 react react-dom
```

We will also need to import the styles of Draft.js, and of the editor:

```scss
@import "draft-js/dist/Draft";
@import "draftail/dist/draftail";
```

Then, import the editor and use it in your code as a React component. Here is a simple example:

```jsx
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"

import { DraftailEditor, BLOCK_TYPE, INLINE_STYLE } from "draftail"

const initial = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem("draftail:content"))

const onSave = (content) => {
  console.log("saving", content)
  sessionStorage.setItem("draftail:content", JSON.stringify(content))
}

const editor = (
  <DraftailEditor
    rawContentState={initial || null}
    onSave={onSave}
    blockTypes={[
      { type: BLOCK_TYPE.HEADER_THREE },
      { type: BLOCK_TYPE.UNORDERED_LIST_ITEM },
    ]}
    inlineStyles={[{ type: INLINE_STYLE.BOLD }, { type: INLINE_STYLE.ITALIC }]}
  />
)

ReactDOM.render(editor, document.querySelector("[data-mount]"))
```

In this example, the editor will have four buttons in its toolbar: H3, bullet list, bold, and italic. Here is a demo of the result:

Draftail supports many more [formatting options](FormattingOptions.md). Be sure to also check out the [required polyfills](BrowserSupport.md).

## Why we need Draft.js and React

[Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) is the framework that Draftail is built upon, meant for rich text experiences in React-driven UIs. **Draftail is an opinionated implementation of a Draft.js editor** – abstracting away the complexities for the simple use cases.

You don’t need any Draft.js knowledge to make use of Draftail, unless you want to invest into more custom rich text formatting. React knowledge is likely needed, however.
