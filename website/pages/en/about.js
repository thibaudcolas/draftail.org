                Draftail came about in 2016, as our team grew more and more
                frustrated with{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail">Wagtail‚Äôs</a> rich
                text editor, and decided to build our own to eventually try and
                replace it.

                Building a{" "}
                <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor
                from scratch is (almost) never a good idea, so we quickly
                settled on <a href="https://draftjs.org">Draft.js</a> as a solid
                WYSIWYG editor framework to build upon. Draft.js + Wagtail ‚Äì¬†

                  Draftail was born

                üéâ .
              </p>
              <p>
                A few years later, Draftail is now very capable for many use
                cases, and it comes with a nice little{" "}

                logo.

              <h2>Ambitions</h2>
              <p>
                The main goal of Draftail is to provide a bullet-proof content
                editing experience for basic rich text content. A modern take on
                WYSIWYG.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  All of the interactions with the editor should be doable with{" "}
                  <a href="/docs/keyboard-shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Power users should be able to use{" "}
                  <a href="/docs/markdown-support">Markdown shortcuts</a> in the
                  editor to format content even faster.
                </li>
                <li>Copy-paste, drag and drop, should just work.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We also want Draftail to be heavily customisable, just like
                Draft.js is, but with sane defaults.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Implementing basic formatting with strong guarantees should
                  just be a matter of configuration ‚Äì No need to reinvent your
                  own Draft.js toolbar.
                </li>
                <li>
                  More advanced extensions should be able to reach out for
                  lower-level APIs, without compromising on consitency of the
                  experience for end users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Experimenting with new capabilities to the editor shouldn‚Äôt
                  require constant core changes ‚Äì there should be{" "}
                  <a href="/docs/plugins">plugin APIs</a>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>As a project, it‚Äôs also fundamental that:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The documentation is outstanding, providing examples of all
                  Draftail capabilities, and general Draft.js editor
                  capabilities
                </li>
                <li>
                  Draftail supports use cases it wasn‚Äôt initially envisioned for
                  ‚Äì like saving Draft.js content to HTML in JavaScript
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Roadmap</h2>
              <p>
                Work on the editor is tracked in GitHub issues, and prioritised
                with{" "}
