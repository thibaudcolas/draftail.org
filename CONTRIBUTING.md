## Favicons

Favicons generated with [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).

Original pencil icon is the [Noun project crayon](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Noun_project_-_crayon.svg) dedicated to the public domain (CC0) by D. Charbonnier.

## Icons

The wesiteâ€™s icons come from [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/). Emojis come from [FxEmojis](https://github.com/mozilla/fxemoji).

## Static editor content

The demo site contains static content exported with [draftjs_exporter](https://github.com/springload/draftjs_exporter). It is placed there for SEO, and also to make the loading experience nicer.

To regenerate it, get the serialised ContentState for the index page's editor (in `sessionStorage`), go to [the Draftail playground](http://playground.draftail.org/), and place the ContentState in the `sessionStorage` value of that editor.
