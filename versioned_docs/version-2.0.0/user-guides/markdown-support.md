Draftail supports formatting content with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup. If you’ve never heard of Markdown this might sound like too much, but in reality it’s really simple, and makes for a much faster content editing experience, with less strange keyboard shortcuts to remember.

Markdown formatting isn’t actually being kept around in the editor – it just serves as a shortcut to format content faster. Here are a few examples:

## Heading levels

Heading levels can easily be formatted with the `#`, `##`, `###`, [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)-style shortcuts. For a heading level 3, use three hash signs – `###` followed by a space at the start of a line:

## Bold, italic, and more

It’s also possible to use Markdown shortcuts for inline formatting, not just at the beginning of a line:

- Use `**`**double asterisks**`**` for bold text.
- Use `_`_underscores_`_` for italicized text.
- Use `~`~~tilde~~`~` to strike through text.

## More shortcuts
